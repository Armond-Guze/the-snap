## 🚨 Important Notes for Future Development

### **Rankings System Special Considerations**
- **Dual Layout Support** - Always check `showAsArticle` boolean for layout mode
- **Team Colors** - Use `style={{ backgroundColor: team.teamColor }}` not Tailwind classes
- **Media Embeds** - YouTube takes priority over Twitter in sidebar
- **Related Content** - Mix rankings and headlines in sidebar for cross-promotion

### **Content Strategy**
- **Professional Tone** - All content should match ESPN/Athletic quality standards
- **SEO Focus** - Every piece of content needs proper meta tags and structured data
- **Mobile Experience** - Touch interactions and responsive design are critical
- **Loading Performance** - Image optimization and lazy loading are mandatory

### **Technical Debt & Known Issues**
- Analytics system is currently console logging (needs database integration)
- Some legacy components may need TypeScript updates
- Image optimization could be further enhanced
- Consider implementing Edge Runtime for better performance

### 🔄 New Navbar & Profile Placeholder (2025-08)

The header has been upgraded:

* Left hamburger opens an off‑canvas mega menu with configurable feature boxes.
* Configuration lives in `app/components/navConfig.ts` – add objects to extend links.
* Centered logo widened to 150px target width.
* Right side now includes persistent `SmartSearch` (desktop + inside panel on mobile) and a `ProfileMenu` placeholder.
* `ProfileMenu` stores a lightweight local profile (favorite team) in `localStorage`; no external auth yet. Selecting a team updates the label; later this can swap the avatar or appear inline.
* Provide a square placeholder avatar image at `public/images/avatar-placeholder.png` (not included by default).
* Focus trapping + ESC support inside the mega menu for accessibility.

Future steps: integrate real authentication (e.g., NextAuth) and persist favorite team to Sanity or a user DB, then surface chosen team’s logo in the navbar.
